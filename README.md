\> Money, though ubiquitous, is a poorly understood technology.

* [Money Is Technology!]( https://dailyreckoning.com/money-is-technology/ )

> Thus, money is, at root, technology as much as any other basic machine like the wedge, lever or wheel. And along with other basic machines, the idea of money has evolved over many thousands of years of human history.

* [Face It: Money Is Technology, And We Can Do Better Than Gold]( https://www.businessinsider.com/face-it-money-is-technology-and-we-can-do-better-than-gold-2012-3 )
