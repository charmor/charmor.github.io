> A constitution is simply the aims and rules that your group will use. It’s a statement of what your group is going to do and how it is going to do it. It is important because:
>
> * Without this written understanding people can easily find themselves at cross purposes and the jobs won’t get done
> * It will serve as a reference, and help to resolve problems in times of controversy
> * Outsiders, especially potential funders, will want to see that your group is democratic and accountable. This involves having a clear procedure by which decisions are made.
