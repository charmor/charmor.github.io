## Maximize human flourishing and minimize human suffering

What are aspects of the human condition that define flourishing and suffering?

1. Development is about people and not about things.
	* When it comes to people and not just about things, the gross national product (GNP) cannot be taken as an indicator. Instead it has to be related to the quality of life (QOL). Quality of life depends on the possibilities people have to adequately satisfy their fundamental human needs.
2. Fundamental human needs are finite, limited in number, and classifiable.
	* This is in contrast to the traditional idea that there are many human needs, and that they are insatiable.
3. Fundamental human needs are the same in all cultures and in all historical periods.
	* This is in contrast to the traditional idea that human needs are subject to trends and vary to a great extent.

### https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need

> A need is something that is necessary for an organism to live a healthy life. Needs are distinguished from wants in that, in the case of a need, a deficiency causes a clear adverse outcome: a dysfunction or death. In other words, a need is something required for a safe, stable and healthy life (e.g. air, water, food, shelter) while a want is a desire, wish or aspiration. When needs or wants are backed by purchasing power, they have the potential to become economic demands.

> Basic needs such as air, water, food and protection from environmental dangers are necessary for an organism to live. In addition to basic needs, humans also have needs of a social or societal nature such as the human need to socialise of belong to a family unit or group. Needs can be objective and physical, such as the need for food, or psychological and subjective, such as the need for self-esteem.

> Needs and wants are a matter of interest in, and form a common substrate for, the fields of philosophy, biology, psychology, social science, economics, marketing and politics.

## coordination problem

> Leave all creative energies uninhibited. Merely organize society to act in harmony with this lesson. Let society’s legal apparatus remove all obstacles the best it can. Permit these creative know-hows freely to flow. Have faith that free men and women will respond to the Invisible Hand.


*https://conceptually.org/concepts/coordination-problems

> Coordination problems are the root cause of a lot of issues in society. Imagine each actor is a player in a game, and must choose a strategy based on the information available to them. Coordination problems are basically ‘games’ with multiple outcomes, so they have to decide how to act.

## Nash Equilibrium

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium

> In game theory, the Nash equilibrium, named after the mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr., is a proposed solution of a non-cooperative game involving two or more players in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no player has anything to gain by changing only their own strategy.


## Economic calculation problem

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem

> The economic calculation problem is a criticism of using economic planning as a substitute for market-based allocation of the factors of production. It was first proposed by Ludwig von Mises in his 1920 article "Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth" and later expanded upon by Friedrich Hayek. In his first article, Mises describes the nature of the price system under capitalism and describes how individual subjective values are translated into the objective information necessary for rational allocation of resources in society.


## Ecumenopolis

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenopolis

> Ecumenopolis (from Greek: οἰκουμένη oecumene, meaning "world", and πόλις polis "city", thus "a city made of the whole world"; pl. ecumenopolises or ecumenopoleis) is the hypothetical concept of a planetwide city. The word was invented in 1967 by the Greek city planner Constantinos Doxiadis to represent the idea that in the future urban areas and megalopolises would eventually fuse and there would be a single continuous worldwide city as a progression from the current urbanization, population growth, transport and human networks. This concept was already current in science fiction in 1942, with Trantor in the Foundation series. When made public, Doxiadis' idea of ecumenopolis seemed "close to science fiction", but today is "suprisingly pertinent" according to geography researchers Pavle Stamenovic, Dunja Predic & Davor Eres, especially as a consequence of globalisation and Europeanisation.

## Public Good

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good

> In economics, a public good is a good that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous in that individuals cannot be excluded from use or could be enjoyed without paying for it, and where use by one individual does not reduce availability to others or the goods can be effectively consumed simultaneously by more than one person.[1] This is in contrast to a common good which is non-excludable but is rivalrous to a certain degree.
